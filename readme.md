### Do you know the story?

_In the enchanted village of Tabula, many miles away from everywhere, every night strange, scary things happen.  
When the sun goes down, while **peasants** 🚜 sleep, some villagers turn into magic creatures:_
- ***werewolves** 🐺: that together look for an innocent victim to satisfy their hunger*
- ***fortune teller** 🧙‍♀️: who has the power to know if a villager is good or bad*
- ***protector** 👮‍♂️: who can protect a villager (himself included) for the night*

_But look over there! He's not one of the previous creatures, he seems to be a normal peasant and he will if only werewolves won't try to murder him, otherwise he will become a damned werewolf too, he's a **werewolf's son** 🐾. So be careful peasants because who is now by your side, one day may be an opponent.<br>_
_At dawn, everyone turns back to its villager state and the sun discloses the results of the night.  The debate can start: who's a damned werewolf, and who's not? All surviving villagers gather every day to discuss the problem, each villager votes one person that he thinks it's a werewolf and the villager with more votes is finally lynched. <br> Will werewolves take control of Tabula? Or the coalition of the honest villagers will be able to defeat them? But above all, will you survive the massacre? Will you be able to convince others to reach your goal? Let's find out!_
